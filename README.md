Security Policies API 
=====================

1. Run composer install
2. Make sure the files in the "var" directory have adequate permissions (I just add 777 for dev purposes).
3. Add the app/config/parameters.yml file. Here the db credentials need to be added.
4. API request example: http://localhost/path_to_dir/security-policies-symf3.4/web/app_dev.php/policy

Based on symfony standard edition.

Enjoy!
